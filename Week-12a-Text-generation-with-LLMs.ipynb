    "Today you will be using [huggingface's SmolLM](https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm), an LLM which has a small parameter count, which means it does not use much space or memory on your PC to run, and can be run efficiently on low-powered consumer hardware like laptops. SmolLM was trained on [a curated dataset of educational and synthetically generated text](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smollm-corpus) designed specifically for conversational instruct-based LLMs.\n",
