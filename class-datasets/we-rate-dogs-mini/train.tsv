1521	13	"""We got our pupper, Casey, from the Hamilton County Humane Society 1 year ago. She came to the shelter as a stray dog who was pregnant and eventually had 13 puppies who were adopted quickly, but she was left behind. When we got her we could tell she had been physically abused. She was petrified of any sudden movement, whether it was towards her or simply near her. Casey would cower if somebody approached her too quickly and yelp in pain if she felt scared. One year later, she is doing much better. Her confidence has gone up tremendously and she is almost a normal dog. She will always be emotionally scarred due to those early years, but she has made great strides. I hope that this story gets shared. I want people to understand that emotionally scarred dogs are not damaged beyond repair. They can be some of the most lovable dogs you meet. I'm so glad we could give Casey a new home and I hope this story inspires others to not ignore dogs because of a background they can't help. Thanks for all you do!  Best Ruffgards, Lily S"" 13/10 "

Trupanion was able to pay my vet directly. Our experience using our policy was a breeze, so I was able to walk out of there knowing we were covered and was able to get Wylder home and resting after his slight sedation to clean out his wound instead of filling out and filing paperwork. We plan for the worst, but having Wylder under a Trupanion policy gives me relief. I would absolutely recommend Trupanion to every dog owner.

To get the allergies under control, his human went looking for a diet that would provide all the nutrients Niko‚Äôs body would need to fight off the solar dermatitis flares. That‚Äôs when she discovered @justfoodfordogs.   After just six weeks on their new diet, Niko showed fewer signs of rash irritation from all his allergies. It was clear his quality of life had improved dramatically with the switch. He can now get back to more important things, like cuddling as close as he possibly can to Keiko. 14/10 for both @justfoodfordogs #partner (thank you @keiko.and.niko for sharing your story with us)

1455	15	This is Hachik≈ç. He was an Akita born on Nov. 10, 1923 in Japan. He was sold to Hidesaburo Ueno, a scientist at the University of Tokyo. Ueno named him Hachi after the number 8, which is considered lucky in Japan, and the two became inseparable. Every day, Hachi walked to Shibuya Station with Ueno for his commute, and he returned each evening to pick him up. This routine continued daily until May 21, 1925. On that sad day, Ueno left for work and never returned, after suffering a fatal cerebral hemorrhage while lecturing.  Despite Ueno's absence, Hachi continued to wait for him at the station daily. Hachi bounced between several homes, including some miles from Shibuya, before settling with Ueno‚Äôs former gardener. No matter the distance, Hachi returned to the station daily to wait patiently for his owner. In 1932, a former student of Ueno‚Äôs published an article about the dog's vigil, and Hachi's story blew up. Hachi became a symbol of loyalty, and ‚Äú-ko,‚Äù a suffix used as a sign of respect, was added to his name. Now called Hachik≈ç, he started receiving pets and treats from people at the station while he awaited his owner.  In 1934, a life-sized statue of the loyal dog was erected at Shibuya Station, and Hachik≈ç himself attended the unveiling ceremony. Hachik≈ç died the next year at the age of 11. Each year since 1936, a solemn ceremony at Shibuya station has been held to honor his devotion. Hachik≈ç's ashes were buried beside Ueno‚Äôs in Tokyo. After nine years, nine months and fifteen days, Hachik≈ç was finally reunited with his beloved owner he missed so much. For his perseverance and loyalty, we bestow upon Hachik≈ç the extremely rare (and long overdue) 15/10 ‚ù§Ô∏è (courtesy @ahistoryofdogs)

Bindi's mom says. ""The staff have been so personable, and it feels more like I'm talking to my long lost friend on the phone rather than a representative. I truly feel like I'm part of the family rather than 'just another customer.' These people care about your pets like they're their own.  ""I started looking for insurance right away and chose Trupanion because of their wide range of coverage, low premiums, and ease of submitting claims. When getting a miniature dachshund, getting pet insurance was a no-brainer for me. Along with all the typical possible reasons to need insurance, dachshunds pose another reason to have it. Their unique long bodies make them prone to IVDD, and while we hope to never face that nightmare it's such peace of mind to know that if we do, Trupanion will have Bindi's back‚Ä¶ quite literally.""

""I feel that dogs are present in all parts of life. A dog appears where you least expect it,"" said Yuri. He was in Mexico covering Pope Benedict's first ever visit to the country. ""As we waited we looked for signs that he was about to show up or not, watching his security‚Äôs movements to try to guess if he was going to appear. That's what was happening when I saw that a dog had come across."" That's right, a little dog decided to steal the Pope's parade. ""I imagine that in that moment he was impressed by the people who cheered with flags, who threw confetti, and all that, and he began to run. He started running in the center of the street. I focus on him and start to take photos. I shoot photos of him, and I shoot and shoot and shoot, following him until he‚Äôs out of the way. Later I discover the photo where he turns to see the crowd and he looks up, and‚Ä¶it gives the impression that he's greeting the crowd‚Ä¶"" Not much is known about the dog in the photo.

2734	12	"""My 16-pound dog Norman was rescued by the San Antonio Great Dane Rescue from a high kill shelter in South Texas. He was at the Great Dane rescue with his giant friends for six months before I adopted him. He was heartworm positive which scared away a lot of hoomans. He also had a decent case of fleas and some pretty bad ear infections. I found out through x-rays for an unrelated issue that he has two pellets forever lodged in his ribs from a gun. Today he is heartworm negative, flea-free, and the most handsome and sweetest boy in all the land. Still occasionally catches rats, no longer relies on them for sustenance.

2840	15	This is Smoky. She was World War II‚Äôs littlest soldier. In 1944, a U.S. soldier found a young Yorkshire Terrier in an abandoned foxhole in New Guinea and named her Smokums. The four-pound pup was sold for just two Australian pounds to Corporal William Wynne, who shortened her name to Smoky.  Smoky served with Wynne in the Air Force, and she was awarded 8 battle stars for her brave acts. She joined on combat flights, backpacked through jungles, survived a typhoon, and once parachuted 30 feet through the air in a parachute made just for her (frame 3). She famously helped repair a damaged communications center by crawling 70 feet through an 8-inch wide culvert with a telegraph wire attached to her collar, saving 250 crewmen from a dangerous 3-day dig.  One day when Wynne was hospitalized with dengue fever, members of Wynne's squad smuggled Smoky in to see him. After a nurse asked if the dog could visit other patients, Smoky began a new task of cheering up sick soldiers. When the war ended, returning soldiers were ordered to leave pets behind, but Wynne smuggled Smoky stateside in an oxygen mask case. Back home, Wynne and Smoky continued to tour hospitals, putting on shows with Smoky's tricks to lift the spirits of recuperating soldiers. She knew how to play dead, walk a tightrope, and even ride a handmade scooter. In 42 live TV performances, she never repeated a trick.  After Smoky died in 1957, Wynne buried her in a World War II ammo box and frequently visited her resting place until he passed away in 2021 at age 99. Smoky is the first therapy dog on record and the first dog to be honored with the Animals in War & Peace Distinguished Service Medal, the highest award American animals can receive. We‚Äôre giving Smoky our highest honor too: a 15/10 (courtesy @ahistoryofdogs)

2120	14	This is Roman. When the Lahaina fires broke out, his dog sitter tried to get them both to safety by jumping into the ocean, but Roman got scared and ran away. Miraculously, he escaped the fires and was taken by a good samaritan to the @MauiHumaneSociety for medical care. Roman had a microchip, and his terrified family immediately came to the shelter when called. While he unfortunately sustained burns on his paws, legs and back, Roman is expected to make a full recovery and is now safe with his family. His sitter also sustained burns and other injuries, but they‚Äôre going to be okay too. In the wake of this terrible tragedy, there will be many more stories like Roman's.

We often feature dogs in need, and unless we‚Äôre explicit about negligence, please assume everyone involved is doing their best.   We are thrilled to say that Baby Girl was adopted last Thursday.

Turns out his @trupanion coverage protects against many things‚Ä¶ just not the seasons changing.   ‚ÄúA normal day of playtime at the river resulted in Mako being rushed to the emergency vet. Mako caught a fish hook in his paw, which tore through his pad and cut an artery. We rushed him to the closest emergency vet. He had already lost a lot of blood. We‚Äôre so thankful for having gotten Trupanion pet insurance for Mako. They paid their portion to the vet directly before we even got Mako back home. Having insurance made us less worried about bills, and able to focus on Mako healing. I highly recommend Trupanion pet insurance; it paid for itself with one visit to the emergency veterinarian. His health is very important, not just because we love him. He is a working service dog and needs to be at his best in order to task for me‚Ä¶ when he isn't working he is quite an adventure dog.‚Äù 13/10 #partner (thank you @makatothemalamute for sharing your Trupanion Tail with us)

112	14	This is Troubadour. He has been a loyal companion and service dog to his human, Katie, for over a decade. He works as her mobility and medical alert dog.  Katie always wanted a dog growing up, but her parents were afraid they wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford emergency vet bills. When she adopted Troubadour, she immediately began researching medical insurance for her pet. She soon found @trupanion and enrolled him right away. ‚ÄúWith all of the amazing care and love Troubadour has provided me over the last ten years it was an incredible relief that when he needed medical care himself, I didn't have to worry about affording the best possible care for him. I was able to focus on spoiling him rotten.‚Äù  Troubadour recently developed a large liver tumor and Katie knew surgery was his best chance. ‚ÄúI hate to think about it, but if I hadn‚Äôt had Trupanion, I would not have been able to make the same decision. I could have maybe tried fundraising for his surgery, but even then, the quote I was given for Troubadour‚Äôs surgery was far less than what his final bill amounted to.‚Äù Troubadour had excessive bleeding during his surgery to remove the tumor.. He survived but with significant blood loss. He needed multiple platelet infusions for the next five days. With every phone call Katie received from the hospital asking if she agreed to another bag of platelets and the associated cost, she was able to say yes. ‚ÄúYes, I can give him everything he needs!‚Äù   ‚ÄúTroubadour is now cancer free, happy, healthy and fully recovered just a few months later. I still have my best friend and service dog because of Trupanion and the incredible veterinarians and technicians who played a role in saving his life.‚Äù 14/10 #partner (Thank you Katie for sharing Troubadour‚Äôs story with us.

Toby is a proud member of our @justfoodfordogs Supper Club. 13/10  ""We started making Toby the JustFoodForDogs DIY beef recipe six months ago. He had a bad back injury from jumping off stairs a few months before that. So we wanted to give him the most nutritious, joint-supporting food we could,‚Äù says Toby's mom. ""To say he loves it is an understatement. He does excited little spins before we put his dish down, and he always licks the bowl clean. He‚Äôs 12.5 years old, but he has the energy of a young pup. He‚Äôs back to running and jumping and zooming around the house. His energy probably went from 7 to 9. He‚Äôs got a lot of spunk.""

1438	13	"Happy #cleartheshelters Day. We'll be posting heartwarming adoption/rescue stories all day (link in bio to contribute) ‚Ä¢ ""This is Bert. He's from Taiwan. When I lost both my 15 year old Golden Retrievers, I knew I had to get another (my 4th) rescued Golden. However, I had moved to a very rural area of Northern California and the closest rescues were 5-6 hours away. Through social media, I was able to find a group in the Lodi/Sacramento area that gets dogs from Taiwan. Apparently, there are many many abandoned Goldens on the streets. There is a large facility/rescue that takes the dogs in and gives them much needed medical care and love. Then they fly them to SF for adoption. Bert came to us as ""Robert"", all skinny and allergic to everything in the woods here but we got that all straightened out. And he immediately became ""Bert"". He is the most lovable, kissable and just plain hilarious boy. He jumps, all 4 legs up at every single ball game, any and all food, hikes and walks, naps on the big bed with us, and every time someone says ""who's a good boy"". Everything delights him and he is interested in everything we do. He loves vacuuming and lawn mowing especially. He loves the snow when it's not too deep. This winter was a drag but he did just fine. Talk about a happy ending!  We are his peeps, he is our boy.  Sorry to send so many pictures. I can't help myself.  Sincerely,  Mary Adams Bert's mom"" 13/10 "

A dog named Breeze (frame 3) didn't have enough red blood cells for an exploratory surgery to identify an internal injury. Carlton's rescue heard the news and called on him for a blood donation. He was on his best behavior during the procedure. The timely transfusion allowed Breeze to get his life-saving surgery, and it wouldn't have been possible without Carlton. Breeze's human is so grateful for their hero and asks anyone interested to contact @renegadepawsrescue about adopting Carlton. He was abandoned last year as a puppy and is more than ready for his forever home. We're covering his adoption fee. 14/10

Still 13/10 #partner  Buford was malnourished and suffered from severe skin issues when he was surrendered to @bassethoundrescueofsocal. Buford‚Äôs foster mom, Jo, was shocked at the severity of Buford‚Äôs health issues. Not only did Buford suffer from severe dermatitis but he also had a heart condition that his vet believed was likely caused by a dietary deficiency. Buford was promptly started on the JustFoodForDogs Chicken & White Rice recipe.  The results were immediate. According to Jo, after his first week on JFFD, Buford‚Äôs skin issues dramatically improved. It has now been over a year. Buford‚Äôs hair has grown back completely. And he no longer suffers from the severe dermatitis that once made him miserable. Buford has also found his forever home with Jo.

The reaction to it was incredible, and Amanda began reaching out to previous clients whose dogs she photographed as puppies. The result was the #DogYearsProject. She estimates she's done this with 65-70 dogs and has no intent of stopping. ""I think people can relate to the visible aging process that the images show...

2748	13	This is Ellie Mae. She was bit by another dog as a puppy and had to have her leg amputated. Even though she's perfectly content with life as a tripod, it means she has a preexisting condition that might deter an owner from pet insurance. But her new owner got a 30-day @trupanion offer anyway, and good thing: Ellie Mae had a tooth abscess and a broken toe, all within about a month of signing up. Fortunately, they covered her care, including casting and X-rays, and her owner continued her plan. Now Ellie Mae and her owner can both rest easy knowing they're covered for new procedures and any emergencies she can't outrun. Thank you @elliemaebabygrey for sharing your #TrupanionTail with us. 13/10  Emergencies happen all the time, and vet bills can add up quickly. Even if your pet has a preexisting condition, you can ask your vet about Trupanion's exam day offer to see what a 30-day offer would cover. #partner

591	12	This is Barney. He's the dog behind the Teddy Bear Massacre. In 2006, a museum in western England opened an exhibit of rare teddy bears that was valued at over $900,000. It even included a bear previously owned by Elvis. One fateful night, Barney and his security guard human, Greg, were on duty guarding the teddy bears. Greg was admiring one in particular, saying what a nice little bear it was, when Barney went on a rampage. For 10 straight minutes, with Greg chasing him around, Barney absolutely shredded 100 teddy bears. Greg said perhaps Barney became jealous of how he spoke to that one bear, as Barney had been a model guard dog until then. After the massacre, dogs were no longer allowed in the exhibit, and Barney has since retired from his guard dog duties. Still 12/10 because maybe they were all haunted and he did us a favor (courtesy @ahistoryofdogs)

The unidentified golden retriever came barreling out of the house for pets, interrupting the burglar long enough to have him put the bike back temporarily and pet the dog‚Äîa testament to the breed's charm but perhaps not their guard dog capabilities.  In the video shared by the local police department, the suspect can be heard praising ""the coolest dog I've ever known"" and seen giving the pup belly rubs, even saying ""I love you"" before fleeing with the three-speed bike valued at $1,300. The dog is all tail wags before watching the guy ride away on the bike. That is when they realized maybe they'd been bamboozled.

1348	14	This is Pickles. He became an international hero in 1966 when he found the World Cup Trophy after it was stolen.  The heist made global headlines and incited panic amongst London's Metropolitan Police. The police even received a ¬£15,000 ransom note together with the removable lining from the top of the trophy.‚Å†‚Å£  Seven days later, David Corbett and his dog Pickles were on their routine walk when Pickles started sniffing under a bush. Wrapped in newspaper, and just hidden enough to avoid discovery, was the World Cup. David ran back to his wife to tell her the news to which she replied ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt look very world cup-y to me.‚Äù  The police soon confirmed it and Pickles was an immediate hero. England went on to win the World Cup that year and Pickles was invited to the winner‚Äôs banquet at a five star hotel where he promptly peed in an elevator. He was probably just a little nervous.   Pickles went on to be named ‚ÄúDog of the Year,‚Äú which came with free food for a year, then he got an agent, and starred in the 1966 film ‚ÄúThe Spy with a Cold Nose.‚Äù  In September of 2018, a plaque was placed near where Pickles found the trophy. 14/10 @ahistoryofdogs

Mitchell, who had adopted two dogs from the shelter previously, applied to adopt Vanessa right away. Torres was thrilled when she received Mitchell‚Äôs application, stating, ‚ÄúNot one person has ever noticed her until now.‚Äù Vanessa is now living out her golden years with Mitchell and her three other rescue dogs, finally receiving all the love and attention she deserves. 13/10 #SeniorPupSaturday (courtesy @villalobosrescuecenterofficial, @lizzyscollo, @snowellieb) "
