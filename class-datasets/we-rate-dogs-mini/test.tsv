I am more than happy to donate to this cause, and to help out The Shelter Project too!  Attached, please find a picture of my two shelter dogs, Nora (the black/white husky/border collie) and Charlie (the red merle border collie). My husband Dan and I adopted them last year from All Herding Breed Dog Rescue (Lockport, IL). Charlie had been waiting for a home for months but because he is blind people were reluctant to adopt him. We met him and he melted our hearts. These two were a wonderful addition to our home.  In March of this year, Dan passed away suddenly. Without Nora and Charlie, I would have been a hopeless mess. Aside from the practical effects (you can't lie in bed all day when the dogs need walks and breakfast and dinner), having these guys in my life has been a blessing. Having dogs to welcome you home and snuggle up to you on the sofa (and hog the bed!) has made me feel needed and loved. I wouldn't trade them for the world!  Thanks again for your efforts.

You never know when unexpected expenses will arise,"" says his mom, ""and I wanted to make sure that no matter what, Keith would receive the very best medical care. Trupanion has made that happen. The entire process is simple; from getting the quote, to signing up, to submitting claims. They even paid the veterinarian directly so there was no need to wait for reimbursement! The best part for me was Trupanion‚Äôs incredibly friendly and helpful team. They clearly understand the love we have for our pets, and they managed to make a very hard situation a lot easier. Pet insurance is the best way to show our pets how much we care, and anybody who wants a simple process from a supportive team who truly cares about their pets should choose Trupanion!""

1691	13	This is Zumma and her sister Skye. They each have a wide range of health issues that require frequent vet visits and medication. But you know what else they have? @Trupanion to help manage the cost of their care and, of course, each other. 13/10 for both #partner  ‚ÄúBoth my girls came to me with pretty severe pre-existing conditions that I was prepared to pay for when adopting them. But I'm so thankful for having Trupanion because of the plethora of other conditions that have come up since then, from food allergies and seasonal allergies to visits to the ER 3 nights in a row for a 4-inch gastric foreign body in her composed of all the things she'd been licking off the floor, including some pieces of cat tree she ate! Because of Trupanion covering the entire thing, I was able to focus my energy on her and not have to make any difficult decisions based on what was in my bank account.  ‚ÄúMy dogs mean everything to me, and I could not live with myself if I ever had to make the decision to say goodbye or let one of my animals suffer because of finances. So YES! I would definitely recommend Trupanion to others! No owner should EVER have to make a decision about their pet's health and longevity based on their access to resources. Pets are family and they deserve to receive gold standard care when needed.‚Äù  Thank you @beagdealzumma for sharing your Trupanion Tail with us ü§ó

1671	14	This is Tilly. He‚Äôs proof that it's never too late to find your dream job. In June 2021, the border collie mix was on a road trip with his family when another car hit their SUV, ejecting Tilly through the rear window. Thankfully no one was seriously injured. But, likely startled, Tilly ran from the scene. Tilly's parents, Linda and Mike Oswald, chased after him, but couldn't keep up. The Oswalds spent the next 10 hours searching for Tilly, sometimes alongside complete strangers who joined the search effort. Linda later posted about the ordeal on Facebook, desperately asking for help finding their beloved pup. Much to the Oswalds‚Äô relief, a farmer commented on the Facebook post that they had spotted the pup herding sheep on their farm. After luring Tilly away from the sheep with salami, they gave him to a local sheriff who reunited Tilly with his overjoyed family. After two days of pursuing a new career, Tilly had lost some weight and was very thirsty, but was otherwise fine. Tilly's instincts most likely drew him to the farm and took over completely when the opportunity to herd sheep presented itself. Linda thinks that if he wasn't found thanks to the kindness of strangers, he would have simply never stopped herding. We‚Äôre giving Tilly and his beefed-up r√©sum√© a 14/10.
