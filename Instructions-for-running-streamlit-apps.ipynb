    "In this task you will be introduced to the [streamlit python library](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit). Streamlit is a python library that allows you to quickly prototype rich, web-based user interfaces that are designed to easily interact with AI models (like pytorch) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit also lets you publish and host your apps publicly on the web using their cloud platform (this service appears to be free currently, but as its a commercial operation, they may start charging for this service at some point). You can take a look at the [streamlit app gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery) to see examples of what can be built using streamlit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this weeks activity, and some of the ones in later weeks, you will be using streamlit to build applications to interact with AI models. There is not time to cover streamlit comprehensively in this course (the activities in class will guide you through building specific use cases related to the class), but if you want to learn streamlit in more depth, then you can walk through their [30 days of streamlit introductory course](https://blog.streamlit.io/30-days-of-streamlit/) in your own time.\n",
