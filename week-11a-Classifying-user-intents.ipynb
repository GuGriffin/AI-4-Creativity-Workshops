    "# Week 7a: Classifying user intents\n",
    "\n",
    "This week you will be learning about how to train a text classifier, that will allow you build chatbots that can recognise and respond to user intents. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you will be training a text classification algorithm, [using the library SetFit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) that can be used to train powerful text classifiers with extremely small amounts of data. In this example you will be [using a dataset with three examples per class](class-datasets/basic_intents_train.csv) (a tiny amount of data!!!). **Because this can be trained with so little data, this is a perfect tool for you to adapt to building chatbots for your own projects!** \n",

    "The code in this notebook is adapted from: https://hackernoon.com/mastering-few-shot-learning-with-setfit-for-text-classification\n",

Try out different values for this threshold to see if you can get the best tradeoff between accurately responding to the intents in the dataset but recognising when an input is not in one of those categories and responding with a different response. \n",
