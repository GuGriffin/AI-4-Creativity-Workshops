    "\n",
    "Have a look for [other datasets of song lyrics on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=song+lyrics+in%3Adatasets), can you adapt the code to work with any of these bigger datasets? \n",
    "> **Warning:** Loading and calculating your BoW or TF-IDF matrix may become very slow if your dataset is very large! If this happens, try [dropping some of the rows from your dataframe](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77145573) before vectorizing if this becomes a problem."
